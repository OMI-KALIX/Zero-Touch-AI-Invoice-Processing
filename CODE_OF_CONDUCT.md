## Responsible Use of AI and Automation

Given the nature of this project, contributors are expected to:

* Design workflows that are ethical, transparent, and explainable
* Avoid automations that enable fraud, harassment, or misuse of data
* Handle invoices, emails, and personal data responsibly

## Data Privacy and Security

* Do not commit real invoices, credentials, API keys, or sensitive data

* Immediately report any accidental exposure of sensitive information

## Open Source Etiquette

* Search existing issues before opening new ones
* Keep discussions technical and relevant

* Accept that maintainers may prioritize issues based on impact and time

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for:

Maintainers have the right to:

* Remove or edit content that violates this Code of Conduct

* Temporarily or permanently ban contributors for severe violations

## Enforcement Guidelines

Violations will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and may result in:

1. **Correction** – A request to change behavior or content
2. **Warning** – A formal warning from maintainers
3. **Temporary Ban** – Limited participation for a defined period
4. **Permanent Ban** – Removal from the project community

The response will aim to be proportional to the impact and intent of the violation.

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

* Open a private issue if possible, or
* Contact the project maintainer directly via GitHub

Reports will be handled discreetly and respectfully.

## Commitment to Continuous Improvement

This project is built in public and evolves over time. We welcome suggestions to improve this Code of Conduct and the overall contributor experience.

Respectful collaboration helps us build automation systems that actually work.
